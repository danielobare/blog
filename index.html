            Just call me Dan,
<br>

                A random guy (Do people have the right to refer themselves as a 'guy'?
                Thought thats for other people to do, but oh well..)

                Daniel Obare Nyakundi.

                I fall in love quickly but its always honest love. Not necessarily the emotion towards people but generally.
<br>
                So there's adventure in my list of buckets, lol. Then I want to travel to the beautiful
<br>
                coasts, swim by the clear waters, try surfing and while at it, make a video that i'll use
<br>
                in summer mix or something. Music too. I appreciate and respect diversity so I have no limitations to what I consider good or bad Music
<br>
                but bad music is just bad. Sauti Sol mastered their art and they definitely have parking space in my Spotify.

                Became a big loyal fan of the theatre in after my high school. The Matrix, after 10 years? released a fourth in their libraries.
<br>
                Surprisingly, we were only five people in the theatre unlike Spiderman's and other marvels..
<br>
                My favorite has and should be for a while, Tenet. A mature plot that not one really ever got to understand the first time. How could you even watch the 
<br>
                piece without subtitles because wueee! Hapo ilikua Mbwe Mbwe
